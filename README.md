# Curriculum-Scheduler
Developed an automated college curriculum scheduler using a Genetic Algorithm to optimize timetables and minimize scheduling conflicts.

<h2>Why Curriculum-Scheduler?</h2>
A Curriculum Scheduler is essential for efficiently managing college class timetables, ensuring optimal use of resources like instructors, classrooms, and meeting times. It automates the complex process of assigning courses, avoiding conflicts such as double-booking instructors or exceeding room capacities. By utilizing a genetic algorithm, the scheduler can quickly generate and refine schedules, balancing constraints and preferences to deliver feasible and optimized timetables. This saves time, reduces errors, and ensures smooth academic operations.
